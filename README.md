# Othello
Code created for the purpose of the Othello competition. Outputs the best move with an Iterative Deepining Depth First Search with accuracy getting better as more time is allowed. Experimental evaluation of a given board is created. An inexperienced othello player (like me) can no longer beat it, given at least 5 seconds to think.
